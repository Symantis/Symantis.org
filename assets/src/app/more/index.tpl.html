						<p>Symantis is a headless organization that is pioneering what we call a Socially Sustained Enterprise. What that means is, when people interact with Symantis as a community, it creates sustainable value. That value is translated into a naturally forming economy that is comparable to a traditional one. Symantis has a non-traditional corporate structure and its only shareholders are its users who help choose the direction that the organization takes. Certain users from within the community are elevated to the roles of staff members whose sole purpose is to help keep the Symantis business model intact and to resolve the organization’s real world issues. 
</p>
					</section>
					<section class="medium-6 columns">
						<p>Symantis is completely funded by its users.  When transactions take place on the Symantis community, a small fraction is used to pay for the organization’s traditional expenses. In addition, the Symantis Organization accepts goodwill capital infusions from outside individuals and corporations under the sole condition that the infusion’s intent is to grow and maintain Symantis.</p>

						<p>Symantis operates on its own currency called SyBit and it is the only currency allowed throughout the Symantis ecosystem. It is a hybrid Torrent/Crypto Currency that allows micro repositories of digital snippets called Manti to be stored directly inside of it. By using SyBit, you not only can create your own Mantis and download others, you become part of the peer to peer network where your efforts are rewarded with currency within the system. </p>
					</section>
					<section class="medium-6 columns">
						<p>Like all crypto currencies, users validate a public ledger of Manti in a process known as mining.  This gives creators a new sense of security and power. This allows for every Manti that is created, refined, or expanded on to be tracked to its origin and credit is given to creators. Even if you are not yet a creator, you can still help the Symantis community by downloading the Symantis SyBit Software and becoming a miner.</p>

						<h3>Build using Manti.</h3>
						<p>You no longer need to reinvent the wheel every time you want to create a new element for your web interface. Symantis breaks down projects into small functional pieces called Manti. Imagine a box of Legos, where each brick is a Manti. Select the piece you want and simply pop it in place in the desired location. Building websites is now this easy. Not only can you create your own Manti as you build up your web app, you can also access a vast open source library, generated by our users.</p>

						<h3>Work in your pipeline.</h3>
						<p>As designers and developers we know that most people move along a pipeline when working on projects. Often one person will work up until a point and then pass it on to another. The Creator App doesn’t forget this, and seamlessly integrates a digital pipeline into your workflow. Working by yourself or in a team is easy. You can see exactly what part of the project everyone is working on, move along at your own speed and even lock down sections if you don’t want to be interrupted by multiple people working on the same part of the project.</p>

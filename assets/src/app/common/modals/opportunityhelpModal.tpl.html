		<p>Applying for an opportunity notifies the author that you are interested in taking up that opportunity. It does not mean that you are guaranteed that opportunity nor does it mean you are committing to anything. It is simply a means of communicating interest. The author of the opportunity will then decide who they want to work with.</p>

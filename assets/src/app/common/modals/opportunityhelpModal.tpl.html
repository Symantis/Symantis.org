		<p>Accepting an opportunity notifies the author that a user is interested in taking up that opportunity. It does not mean that you are guaranteed that opportunity nor does it mean you are commiting to anything. It is simply a means of communicating interest. The author of the opportunity will then decide who they want to work with.</p>
